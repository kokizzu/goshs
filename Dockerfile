# Stage 1: Build the Go application
# Pin the builder to the build host's native platform and cross-compile to the
# requested target. This avoids running the (slow) Go toolchain under QEMU when
# building multi-arch images with buildx.
#
# BUILDPLATFORM is predefined by buildx, but the classic builder (used by the
# testcontainers integration build) does not set it — without a default it would
# expand to an empty `--platform=` and fail. The default only takes effect on
# that path; buildx overrides it per build. It selects the builder node only and
# never affects the produced binary's architecture (that is TARGETARCH below).
